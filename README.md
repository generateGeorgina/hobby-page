Hobby-page following MDN's Getting Started With The Web, freeCodeCamp and W3Schools as well as mentors and the internet in general.
This project was created as part of an application to Founders and Coder's pre-application requirements.
To build this website, I started building the current infopage as the main page first. Then as it gained more content and functionality, I created a short form on what is now the homepage. I also added some original poems I made up as I was learning to code. Most of my inspiration for javascript functionaility was from MDN Web Docs.
